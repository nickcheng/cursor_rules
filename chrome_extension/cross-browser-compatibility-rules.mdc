description: Rules for ensuring the extension works reliably across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other Chromium‑based browsers.
globs: **/*.{js,ts,html}
---
- Use the WebExtensions API subset wherever possible; avoid Chrome‑only APIs unless absolutely required.
- Detect browser vendor at runtime with `const browser = chrome || (globalThis as any).browser`.
- Guard vendor‑specific features behind capability checks (`if (chrome?.scripting) { … }`).
- Keep the manifest at **v3** and validate with both Chrome and Firefox linter tools before release.
- Avoid proprietary CSS prefixes; rely on standard Flexbox / Grid properties.
- Do **not** assume the presence of `chrome.storage.sync`—provide a local fallback for browsers that disable it.
- Test alarms and notifications on at least Chrome Stable, Edge Stable, and Firefox Latest ESR each release cycle.
- Provide polyfills (e.g., `browser-polyfill`) only as a dev‑dependency; tree‑shake them from production bundles.
- Maintain a `/compatibility.md` changelog noting any newly introduced vendor quirks and their work‑arounds.
