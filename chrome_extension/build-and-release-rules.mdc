description: Rules governing bundling, versioning, and releasing the Chrome extension.
globs: **/manifest.json
---
- Use an automated build pipeline (e.g., pnpm + Vite + crxjs) to output a signed `.crx` and an unpacked `/dist`.
- Increment `manifest.version` **patch** automatically on every CI build; `minor` for features, `major` for breaking permission changes.
- Generate a deterministic content hash for bundled assets and reference via `import.meta.url` where needed.
- Validate the final manifest against `chrome://extensions/?errors` **and** `web-ext lint` for Firefox before tagging a release.
- Embed the exact Git commit SHA in `manifest.version_name` for traceability.
- Run `npm audit` and `pnpm dlx license-checker` in CI; fail build on high‑severity vulnerabilities or unapproved licenses.
- Produce a signed change‑log (`CHANGELOG.md`) with every Git tag following Conventional Commits.
- Attach the zipped `dist/` artifact to the GitHub Release; publish to Chrome Web Store & AMO using respective upload CLIs.
